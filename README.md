# WTF is this ?
It's a naive and overly complicated program that is attempting to find 2 prime factors to a given number.
It can only find 2 factors, and it does a primality check to see if both factors are indeed prime numbers.

# HTF do I run this?
The code is written in rust. To get a rust compiler, you have to google what `rustup` is.
If or when you have installed rust, running `cargo build` and `cargo run --release` should just
work when run from inside the working directory of this repository.
